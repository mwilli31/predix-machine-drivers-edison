# What has been done
The Driver Developer has been used to install mraa and upm, attempt to setup the driver and create the service

To learn more in depth on what the Driver Developer is actually doing, read the DriverDeveloperREADME

Mraa and upm should be installed properly in the GroveSetupRequired file

The upm libraries have been installed

# What needs to be done
All editing should be done in DriverDeveloperJava when done testing, this will allow you to replicate these drivers
	The DriverDeveloper simply writes the files in order, to get information about the different json data used, read the section in the DriverDeveloperREADME

The driver specific libraries (upm_th02, upm_grove ... etc) need to be properly linked
	You will get an issue with java.library.path not being able to load modules

The driver setup script has to be made to compile the java (I tried doing a javac of the .java file)
	This must be done before reaching the service setup script

The service setup script should run properly, if a different method is used to run the java other than a javac <name>.java followed by java <name>, edit the line starting with ExecStart
	Note: all paths must be absolute
